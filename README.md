# go-r-obot
>  Discord Bot that tracks how many Subreddits mentioned, rewritten in go

r-obot tracks how many times `r/<insert text here>` is mentioned in one of the messages on your server. It responds with various jokes related to the total message count.

Newly added in this go rewrite are unit tests in `main_test.go` as well as better joke generation.

## Running
First create a `.secret` text file beside the `main.go` and place your Discord API secret key in it.

Then make sure go is installed and on your path then run
```sh
go run main.go
```
To test run
```sh
go test main.go main_test.go
```
The `file.go` file is used to create a data file with a certain count.
To use it replace `336` in the `fmt.Sprint()` statement in `file.go` with the initial count you want and then run
```sh
go run file.go
```
You should then see the `data.txt` file

## Developing

Make sure go and git are installed and on your path then run
```sh
git clone https://github.com/sirfredrick/go-r-obot.git
```
then follow the above steps for running it.
